        <h2>What is PCOS?</h2>
        <p>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder affecting people with ovaries during their reproductive years. PCOS is characterized by hormonal imbalances that can affect overall health and appearance, and is a leading cause of infertility.</p>

        <h2>Common Symptoms of PCOS</h2>
        <p>PCOS symptoms can vary from person to person. Some experience mild symptoms, while others may have more severe manifestations. Here are the most common symptoms:</p>
        
        <div class="symptoms-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Menstrual Irregularities</h3>
                <p>Infrequent, irregular, or prolonged menstrual cycles are the most common sign of PCOS. Some women may have fewer than nine periods a year, more than 35 days between periods, or abnormally heavy periods.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Excess Androgen</h3>
                <p>Elevated levels of male hormones (androgens) may result in physical signs such as excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), severe acne, and male-pattern baldness.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Polycystic Ovaries</h3>
                <p>Ovaries might be enlarged and contain follicles that surround the eggs. This can cause the ovaries to fail to function regularly and may be visible on ultrasound.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Weight Gain</h3>
                <p>About 80% of women with PCOS are overweight or obese, often with weight concentrated around the abdomen (apple-shaped body).</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Skin Changes</h3>
                <p>Darkening of skin, particularly along neck creases, in the groin, and underneath breasts (acanthosis nigricans). Skin tags may also appear in the armpits or neck area.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Emotional Effects</h3>
                <p>Many women with PCOS experience depression, anxiety, poor self-esteem, and reduced quality of life due to symptoms like weight gain, infertility, and hirsutism.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Prevention and Risk Reduction</h2>
        <p>While PCOS cannot always be prevented, certain lifestyle changes can help reduce symptoms and prevent complications:</p>
        
        <div class="prevention-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Maintain Healthy Weight</h3>
                <p>Losing just 5-10% of your body weight can help regulate your menstrual cycle and improve cholesterol and insulin levels, reducing diabetes and heart disease risk.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Balanced Diet</h3>
                <p>Focus on high-fiber foods, lean proteins, and anti-inflammatory foods. Reduce intake of refined carbohydrates, sugary foods, and processed foods to help manage insulin levels.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Regular Exercise</h3>
                <p>At least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days can help lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. Both aerobic and resistance training are beneficial.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Monitor Blood Sugar</h3>
                <p>Regular check-ups for glucose tolerance and insulin resistance can help detect problems early. Women with PCOS should be screened for type 2 diabetes regularly.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Stress Management</h3>
                <p>Chronic stress can worsen PCOS symptoms. Practices like yoga, meditation, deep breathing, and adequate sleep can help manage stress levels.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Regular Check-ups</h3>
                <p>Regular visits to your healthcare provider for pelvic exams, blood pressure checks, cholesterol screening, and diabetes screening are important for early detection of complications.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Management and Treatment Options</h2>
        <p>While there's no cure for PCOS, various treatments can help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of long-term complications:</p>
        
        <div class="management-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Lifestyle Changes</h3>
                <p>The first line of treatment typically involves weight loss through diet and exercise. Even modest reduction in weight (5-10%) can improve symptoms significantly.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Medications</h3>
                <p>Birth control pills can regulate menstruation and reduce androgen levels. Metformin improves insulin resistance. Anti-androgen drugs can reduce hair growth and acne.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Fertility Treatments</h3>
                <p>For those trying to conceive, medications like clomiphene or letrozole can induce ovulation. In vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an option if medications don't work.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Hair Removal</h3>
                <p>Options for excess hair include laser hair removal, electrolysis, prescription creams, and other cosmetic treatments to manage unwanted hair growth.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Surgical Options</h3>
                <p>Ovarian drilling is a laparoscopic procedure that can induce ovulation by destroying androgen-producing tissue in the ovaries with an electric current.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Alternative Therapies</h3>
                <p>Some women find relief with acupuncture, herbal supplements (like cinnamon or spearmint tea), or inositol supplements, though more research is needed on their effectiveness.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Important Note:</h3>
            <p>PCOS management should be tailored to each individual's symptoms, reproductive plans, and risk of long-term health problems. Always consult with a healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan that's right for you.</p>
